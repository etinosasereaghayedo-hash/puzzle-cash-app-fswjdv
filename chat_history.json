You want an app where users can solve puzzles and earn real money for each puzzle solved. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Puzzle Display:** A screen to display the puzzles.\n*   **Solving Mechanism:** A way for users to interact with and solve the puzzles.\n*   **Reward System:** Integrate a mechanism to reward users with $10 upon successful puzzle completion.\n*   **User Authentication:** Implement a simple login/signup flow to track user progress and earnings.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f4f7` (Light gray)\n    *   Text: `#2d3436` (Dark gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#747d8c` (Medium gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#ffc107` (Yellow)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#28a745` (Green)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  **Set up User Authentication:** Since you want users to earn real money, you'll need a way to track their progress and earnings. For this, you'll need to enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button, and connecting to a project (you might need to create one in Supabase first).\n2.  **Create Puzzle Component:** Design a component to display individual puzzles. This component will handle user interaction and determine if the puzzle is solved correctly.\n3.  **Implement Reward Logic:** Upon successful puzzle completion, trigger a function that credits the user's account with $10. This will likely involve updating the user's data in Supabase.\n4.  **Design Home Screen:** Create a home screen that displays a list of available puzzles.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between the home screen, puzzle display, and user profile.\n\nNow, I'll instruct the coding agent to implement the plan. After the implementation, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-26T05:11:28.847046"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll implement the puzzle app with a reward system.

I've implemented a complete puzzle rewards app with the following features:\n\n## What I've Built:\n\n### 1. **Color Scheme** \u2705\n- Updated `styles/commonStyles.ts` with the exact colors specified in the plan\n- Background: `#f0f4f7` (Light gray)\n- Text: `#2d3436` (Dark gray)\n- Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)\n- Accent: `#ffc107` (Yellow)\n- Highlight: `#28a745` (Green)\n\n### 2. **Puzzle System** \ud83e\udde9\n- Created 8 different puzzles (Math, Word, and Logic types)\n- Each puzzle has multiple-choice answers\n- Difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard\n- Each solved puzzle earns $10\n\n### 3. **Home Screen** \ud83c\udfe0\n- Displays total earnings and puzzles solved at the top\n- Lists all available puzzles with:\n  - Color-coded difficulty badges\n  - Type icons (math, word, logic)\n  - Reward amounts\n  - Completion status\n- Smooth animations with React Native Reanimated\n\n### 4. **Puzzle Detail Screen** \ud83c\udfaf\n- Shows the puzzle question\n- Multiple-choice options\n- Real-time feedback (correct/incorrect)\n- Visual indicators with checkmarks/X marks\n- Haptic feedback on iOS\n- Instant reward notification when solved\n\n### 5. **Profile Screen** \ud83d\udc64\n- Total earnings display\n- Statistics:\n  - Puzzles solved\n  - Completion rate\n  - Total progress\n- \"How It Works\" guide\n- Reset progress button\n- Disclaimer that earnings are simulated\n\n### 6. **Context Management** \ud83d\udce6\n- Created `PuzzleContext` to manage:\n  - Puzzle state\n  - User profile\n  - Earnings tracking\n  - Progress tracking\n\n### 7. **Features** \u2b50\n- Smooth animations throughout\n- Haptic feedback on iOS\n- Clean, modern UI\n- Responsive design\n- Works on both iOS and Android\n- Floating tab bar navigation\n\n### Important Note:\n**This app simulates earning money.** The earnings are tracked within the app but are not real money. To implement actual payments, you would need to:\n\n1. Enable Supabase by pressing the Supabase button and connecting to a project\n2. Integrate a payment processor like Stripe\n3. Implement user authentication\n4. Add backend validation to prevent cheating\n5. Comply with financial regulations\n\nThe app is fully functional as a demo and provides a great user experience for solving puzzles and tracking progress!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-26T05:11:18Z"}]
